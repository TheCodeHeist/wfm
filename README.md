# **wfm**

> **Update!** Lexer can recognize Headings

**Web-flavoured Markdown (wfm)** to use for building websites without new functionalities, without the use of HTML.

**wfm** will get all the features from a traditional markdown flavour like **gfm (Github-flavoured Markdown)** but some extra-features added to it, which aren't in traditional **gfm**. Thus, markdown will not only be used as a static blog generator, but also a relatively easier alternative for **HTML**.

Since, **wfm** will have other new syntaxes - e.g. for buttons, divisions, etc. - I am making a Lexer and a Parser from scratch. You can see how things are working by forking the project, and make sure each time you open the project you fetch the project again to get the updated code.

Make sure you watch this project if you fork it, to get the latest pushes!

Please leave a star!! ⭐ 

### **Instructions for forking the project**

1. Go to the project's [github](https://github.com/TheCodeHeist/wfm) page.
2. Click on the **Watch** and **Fork** buttons on the top-right corner.
3. (OPTIONAL) Don't leave the **Star** button unchecked!
4. After forking, go to your repository where you forked this project.
5. Click on the successful green **Code** button.
6. A small box near it should appear. Choose your cloning method now.
   
   If you have [**Github Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/):
   1. Click on the **Open with Github Desktop** button.
   2. It should open up Github Desktop in your machine, and eventually clone your forked project.
   
   If you want to do that with [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/):
   1. Open your Git Bash terminal.
   2. `cd` into the directory where you want to clone it.
   3. Type in:
      ```bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/wfm.git
      ```
      and get it cloned.
7. Well enough! Now go the project folder. Open the directory with any code editor like [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [**Atom**](https://atom.io/), [**Sublime Text**](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
8. Then open the terminal on that directory, and type in:
   ```bash
   # For Only-NPM Users
   $ npm i

   # For Yarn & NPM Users
   $ yarn
   ```
9. After all dependencies got installed, type in:
   ```bash
   # For Only-NPM Users
   $ npm run dev

   # For Yarn & NPM Users
   $ yarn dev
   ```
   to run the project.
10. Finally done! ✨✨
